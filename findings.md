# Findings & Decisions

## Requirements
- Analyze the current branch of `/Users/luchen/Repo/cinderx` relative to official CPython source in `/Users/luchen/Repo/cpython`.
- Use `ebf955df7a89ed0c7968f79faec1de49f61ed7cb` as the benchmark baseline reference.
- Produce a detailed plan, not code changes.
- Explain likely causes for regressions in these benchmarks, prioritized: `coroutines`, `comprehensions`, `richards`, `richards_super`, `go`, `deltablue`, `raytrace`, `nqueens`, `float`, `generators`, `python_startup`.
- Focus on Arm vs AMD performance differences; possible causes include x86-specific wins, Arm-specific regressions, or larger x86 uplift than Arm.
- The main performance environment is isolated Linux Arm.
- Local macOS Arm can be used for functional probing, reproducer reduction, dump generation, and path validation, but not as final performance evidence.
- Because the target environment is network-isolated, the preferred workflow is: analyze likely difference points first, then generate one-click scripts that collect the minimum confirmation data in the isolated environment.

## Research Findings
- Skills in use for this turn: `using-superpowers`, `writing-plans`, `planning-with-files`.
- `planning-with-files` helper `session-catchup.py` was unavailable at the expected path, so planning files were initialized manually.
- The upstream baseline commit `ebf955df7a89ed0c7968f79faec1de49f61ed7cb` is available in `/Users/luchen/Repo/cpython` but not in the local `/Users/luchen/Repo/cinderx` history, so direct `git diff <commit>...HEAD` inside `cinderx` does not work.
- The comparison method therefore needs to be cross-repo and path-based: compare `cinderx` HEAD working tree against `/Users/luchen/Repo/cpython` at commit `ebf955...`, then focus on runtime hot paths relevant to the benchmark list.
- `cinderx` is an extension-style repository, not a full CPython source tree. The relevant deltas versus stock CPython are concentrated in:
  - `cinderx/Interpreter/3.14/*` for interpreter-loop changes
  - `cinderx/Jit/*` for compilation/runtime/codegen behavior
  - `cinderx/StaticPython/*` and checked-container paths
  - startup glue such as `setup.py`, `cinderx/PythonBin/sitecustomize.py`, and the ARM pyperformance setup scripts
- Existing local deliverables already document verified ARM issues and fixes in:
  - interpreter overhead vs CPython
  - `raytrace` mixed-numeric deopts
  - `float` accumulator and `**2` lowering
  - `generators` attr/decref expansion
  - mutable `LOAD_GLOBAL` guards
- Current branch recent commits are heavily concentrated in JIT HIR/LIR optimization work, especially:
  - mixed numeric guards
  - float fast paths
  - generator attr/decref lowering
  - list slice / len arithmetic / compact-long loop unboxing
- Current code shows ARM-specific defaults enabled in OSS 3.14:
  - `ENABLE_ADAPTIVE_STATIC_PYTHON` default on ARM in `setup.py`
  - `ENABLE_LIGHTWEIGHT_FRAMES` default on ARM in `setup.py`
  - pyperformance worker env auto-loads CinderX through generated `sitecustomize.py`
- Current interpreter-loop deltas relative to CPython include:
  - delayed adaptive enablement via `Ci_DelayAdaptiveCode`, `Ci_AdaptiveThreshold`, and `is_adaptive_enabled()`
  - extra `adaptive_enabled` parameter threaded through tail-call interpreter helpers
  - conditional `ADVANCE_ADAPTIVE_COUNTER`
  - `CI_SET_ADAPTIVE_INTERPRETER_ENABLED_STATE` and `CI_UPDATE_CALL_COUNT`
  - custom PEP 523 and awaitable/coroutine handling through `Ci_EvalFrame`, `JitCoro_GetAwaitableIter`, and `JitGen_yf`
- Current JIT code includes an explicit benchmark-informed policy:
  - exact int guards on specialized numeric opcodes are only kept for code objects with a backedge
  - float exact guards remain enabled for float-only leaf helpers
- The plan should now optimize for offline execution:
  - convert each likely difference point into a small number of measurable checks
  - package those checks into one-click scripts instead of relying on iterative interactive exploration in the isolated environment

## Technical Decisions
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Structure the work as repository-state check -> diff mapping -> benchmark correlation -> prioritized plan | Keeps the deliverable evidence-based and easy to execute later |
| Organize benchmark analysis by shared root-cause cluster before per-benchmark detail | Several listed benchmarks likely regress for the same reason |
| Distinguish three cause categories in the final analysis: x86-only uplift, ARM-only regression, and larger x86 uplift than ARM | Matches the user's decision frame |
| Treat local macOS Arm only as a piercing/probing platform | Useful for reproducer validation and dump generation, but not acceptable as final performance evidence |
| Prefer script generation after difference-point analysis instead of ad hoc remote commands | The Linux Arm environment is isolated, so batchable one-click data collection is more efficient and repeatable |

## Issues Encountered
| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Missing planning skill helper script | Continued with manual file creation |
| Upstream baseline commit not reachable from `cinderx` history | Switched to cross-repo file/tree comparison |

*Remote verification evidence updated on 2026-02-24 against `124.70.162.35`.*

## 2026-02-25 ARM verification (124.70.162.35)

- Scope: verify `ENABLE_ADAPTIVE_STATIC_PYTHON` works both without LTO and with LTO enabled.
- Build environment: `/root/venv-cinderx314` + Python 3.14 on aarch64.

### Code/Build adjustments used in this run

- `CMakeLists.txt` LTO logic keeps `ld.lld` preference for Clang LTO.
- `CMakeLists.txt` FetchContent sources switched from `GIT_REPOSITORY` to fixed `codeload.github.com` tarball URLs for:
  - `asmjit`
  - `fmt`
  - `parallel-hashmap`
  - `usdt`

## 2026-02-25 New Task: ENABLE_LIGHTWEIGHT_FRAMES + LTO/PGO/ADAPTIVE_STATIC (ARM 3.14)

### Requirements captured
- Enable and debug `ENABLE_LIGHTWEIGHT_FRAMES` on official Python 3.14 ARM server.
- Must coexist with:
  - `CINDERX_ENABLE_LTO=1`
  - `CINDERX_ENABLE_PGO=1`
  - `ENABLE_ADAPTIVE_STATIC_PYTHON=1`
- Workflow explicitly required:
  - brainstorming -> writing-plans -> test-driven-development -> verification-before-completion
- All tests and validation must run through remote entrypoint (`<远端测试入口>`).
- Key outcomes/evidence must be recorded in `findings.md`.

### Initial discoveries
- Existing setup defaults currently gate `ENABLE_LIGHTWEIGHT_FRAMES` to meta 3.12 path, not 3.14 by default.
- Previous work already stabilized adaptive static + LTO on ARM 3.14 and switched CMake dependency fetches to codeload tarballs for reliability.

### Open questions to resolve in brainstorming
1. Exact command/script that user wants treated as `<远端测试入口>` for this task.
2. Authoritative signal for "lightweight frames enabled" acceptance.
3. Required verification breadth (targeted tests only vs targeted + smoke suite).

### Context exploration updates (brainstorming)
- `setup.py` currently sets `ENABLE_LIGHTWEIGHT_FRAMES` default to `meta_312` only.
- C++ side already has many `#ifdef ENABLE_LIGHTWEIGHT_FRAMES` and 3.14-specific code paths (`PY_VERSION_HEX >= 0x030E0000`) in JIT runtime/frame/codegen files.
- There is currently no user-facing API equivalent to `is_adaptive_static_python_enabled()` for lightweight-frames compile-time state.
- Existing tests cover adaptive-static behavior (`tests/test_setup_adaptive_static_python.py`, `tests/test_cinderx_adaptive_static_api.py`, `test_oss_quick.py`) but do not yet assert lightweight-frames enablement.

### 2026-02-25 Brainstorming decision update
- User decision: prioritize Python 3.14 support for `ENABLE_LIGHTWEIGHT_FRAMES`.
- Design adjustment: Stage A default enable scope targets 3.14 first (ARM), not broad 3.15 rollout.

## 2026-02-26 Completion Evidence: LIGHTWEIGHT_FRAMES + LTO/PGO/ADAPTIVE_STATIC (ARM 3.14)

### Stage-A policy confirmation
- `setup.py` now applies:
  - `ENABLE_LIGHTWEIGHT_FRAMES` default `ON` for OSS Python `3.14` on `aarch64/arm64`
  - `ENABLE_LIGHTWEIGHT_FRAMES` default `OFF` for `3.15` in Stage A (still manually overridable via env)
  - existing meta `3.12` behavior preserved
- User-confirmed rollout:
  - prioritize 3.14 now
  - x86 extension deferred
  - 3.15 deferred, stage-A default-off accepted

### Additional robustness fix for PGO
- Symptom observed:
  - intermittent `test_generators` failure during `PGO STAGE 2/3` workload caused `setup.py install` failure with `CINDERX_ENABLE_PGO=1`.
- Fix:
  - added `run_pgo_workload()` in `setup.py`
  - bounded retry on workload failure (`2` attempts total)
  - wired `BuildCommand._run_with_pgo()` to use helper
- TDD:
  - RED: `tests/test_setup_pgo_workload_retries.py` failed (`AttributeError: module 'setup' has no attribute 'run_pgo_workload'`)
  - GREEN: same test passed after helper implementation

### Remote test entrypoint
- All verification executed through:
  - `ssh root@124.70.162.35`
- Remote runtime:
  - Python `3.14.3`
  - arch `aarch64`

- Stage-A policy is as requested:
  - 3.14 prioritized
  - 3.15 default-off (manual env override still available)
  - x86 extension deferred to later phase

## 2026-02-27 Task: CPython Native vs CinderX (Interpreter + JIT) on ARM 3.14

### Requested workflow status
- Requested process: `brainstorming -> writing-plans -> test-driven-development -> verification-before-completion`.
- Requested skills: `using-superpowers` + `planning-with-files`.
- Session constraints observed:
  - active skill registry in this session does not include those two skills,
  - `skill-installer` helper could not be executed because local `python` is unavailable.

### Brainstorming results
- Existing benchmark evidence is already sufficient to explain the main behavior pattern:
  - cold/short-run results often make JIT look slower,
  - warm/steady-state results can show JIT speedups.
- Current richards runner contract does not include an explicit "pure CPython native (no CinderX import)" mode:
  - `scripts/bench/run_richards_remote.sh` supports `nojit`, `jitlist`, `autojit50`.
  - `scripts/arm/remote_update_build_test.sh` injects `sitecustomize.py` that auto-loads CinderX unless `CINDERX_DISABLE=1`.
  - Therefore current `nojit` should be interpreted as "CinderX loaded, JIT disabled", not pure CPython baseline.

### Writing-plans output
- Plan file created: `docs/plans/2026-02-27-cpython-vs-cinderx-314-arm-analysis.md`.

### TDD status for this task
- RED/GREEN target defined:
  - add explicit `cpython` mode to richards sampling contract,
  - then compare `cpython` vs `cinderx_nojit` vs `jitlist` vs `autojit50`.
- Execution status:
  - blocked before RED/GREEN run because remote verification entrypoint is currently unreachable in this session.

### Verification attempts via `<remote test entry>`
- Attempted remote entry command:
  - `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/push_to_arm.ps1 -RepoPath c:\work\code\cinderx -WorkBranch bench-cur-7c361dce -ArmHost 124.70.162.35 -SkipPyperformance`
- Result:
  - failed in `sync_upstream.ps1` at `git fetch origin` (`Failed to connect to github.com:443` / connection reset).
- Direct host connectivity checks:
  - `ssh root@124.70.162.35 "echo remote-ok"` -> `Permission denied (publickey,...)`
  - `ssh root@106.14.164.133 "echo remote-ok"` -> `Permission denied (publickey,...)`

### Performance evidence used for analysis (existing validated artifacts)
- Source: `artifacts/richards/arm_samples_20260221_091757.json`
  - `nojit` mean: `0.0534650194 s`
  - `jitlist` mean: `0.0547409418 s` (`+2.386%` vs nojit, slower)
  - `autojit50` mean: `0.0520960826 s` (`-2.560%` vs nojit, faster)
- Source: prior cold/short-run section (`pyperformance --fast`) in this file:
  - nojit `103 ms`, jitlist `181 ms`, autojit50 `191 ms` (JIT appears much slower).
- Source: prior warm-loop tail section in this file:
  - nojit tail-30 `0.2130860543 s`
  - jitlist tail-30 `0.1841729017 s` (`-13.57%`)
  - autojit50 tail-30 `0.0810525232 s` (`-61.96%`)

### Why ARM 3.14 can look "full" / slower
- Benchmark regime mismatch:
  - in short/cold runs, JIT compile and initialization overhead dominates;
  - in warm runs, compiled-path wins can appear after overhead amortization.
- Low-latency floor + host noise:
  - many ARM samples are near `~0.05s`; sub-1% gains are easily hidden by jitter/outliers.
- Baseline definition gap:
  - current "nojit" is not pure CPython native, so "CPython vs CinderX" can be misread.
- Threshold/workload interaction:
  - `autojit` behavior depends on call counts and worker lifecycle; short tasks may pay compile cost without enough hot-loop reuse.

### Next required step for definitive answer
- Add and validate explicit `cpython` sampling mode (`CINDERX_DISABLE=1`) through the same remote entry flow, then re-run comparison matrix after remote auth/network is restored.

## 2026-02-27 Remote Run: CPython Native (interp/JIT) vs CinderX (interp/JIT)

### Remote target
- Host: `root@124.70.162.35`
- Arch: `aarch64`

### Environment facts observed
- Existing CPython at `/opt/python-3.14/bin/python3.14` had:
  - `sys._jit.is_available() == False`
  - i.e. cannot directly run native CPython JIT there.
- Built a JIT-enabled CPython 3.14.3 under tmpfs:
  - install path: `/tmp/cpython314jit/install/bin/python3.14`
  - build source: `/tmp/cpython314jit/src` from `Python-3.14.3.tgz`
  - config: `--enable-experimental-jit=yes-off`
  - verification:
    - default: `sys._jit -> (True, False)`
    - `PYTHON_JIT=1`: `sys._jit -> (True, True)`
- CinderX runtime path:
  - `/root/venv-cinderx314/bin/python`
  - JIT API sanity check:
    - `cinderx.jit.force_compile(f) == True`
    - compiled size observed (`f`): `960` bytes.

### Practical blocker and workaround
- Root filesystem is full (`/` at 100%), so `pyperformance run` default venv root under `/root/venv` fails.
- Workaround used:
  - build CPython JIT in `/tmp` (tmpfs),
  - run benchmark directly via `bm_richards/run_benchmark.py` + `--debug-single-value`,
  - avoid pyperformance's internal auto-venv creation in `/root`.

### Benchmark method
- Benchmark script:
  - `/root/venv-cinderx314/lib/python3.14/site-packages/pyperformance/data-files/benchmarks/bm_richards/run_benchmark.py`
- Samples per mode: `5`
- Modes:
  - `cpython_interp`: `/tmp/venv-cpython314jit/bin/python`, `PYTHON_JIT=0`
  - `cpython_jit`: `/tmp/venv-cpython314jit/bin/python`, `PYTHON_JIT=1`
  - `cinderx_interp`: `/root/venv-cinderx314/bin/python`, `PYTHONJITDISABLE=1`
  - `cinderx_jit`: `/root/venv-cinderx314/bin/python`, `PYTHONJITAUTO=50`

### Key results (richards, lower is better)
- Artifact:
  - `artifacts/richards/direct_richards_cpython_cinderx_autojit_20260227_130845.json`

- Means:
  - `cpython_interp`: `0.0516462776 s`
  - `cpython_jit`: `0.0486890842 s`
    - vs CPython interp: `-5.726%` (faster)
  - `cinderx_interp`: `0.0520793502 s`
    - vs CPython interp: `+0.839%` (slower)
  - `cinderx_jit` (`autojit50`): `0.0516185456 s`
    - vs CinderX interp: `-0.885%` (faster)
    - vs CPython JIT: `+6.017%` (slower)

### Notes on interpretation
- This run is a same-host, same-benchmark comparison and uses the actual requested four categories.
- Because host variance still exists, treat this as directional for this machine/setup.
- In this sample set:
  - CPython native JIT gain is clear over CPython interp.
  - CinderX JIT gain over CinderX interp is present but small.

## 2026-02-27 Assembly Diff: CinderX JIT vs CPython Native JIT (AArch64)

### Setup
- Host: `root@124.70.162.35`
- Function shape on both sides:
  - `def f(n): s=0; for i in range(n): s += i; return s`
- CinderX:
  - force-compiled `f`
  - dumped JIT ELF, extracted `.text`, disassembled as AArch64
- CPython native JIT:
  - `PYTHON_JIT=1`
  - executor found at `JUMP_BACKWARD` offset `50`
  - disassembled `get_jit_code()` blob (head `952` bytes for same-size window)

### Key evidence artifacts
- `artifacts/asm/cinderx_f_disasm_aarch64.txt`
- `artifacts/asm/cpython_executor_disasm_head952_aarch64.txt`
- `artifacts/asm/cpython_executor_disasm_head2880_aarch64.txt`
- `artifacts/asm/cinderx_f_text.bin`

- design note: `docs/plans/2026-02-27-cinderx-vs-cpython-jit-asm-aligned.md`

### Quantitative summary
- Byte-level equal-size compare (`952` vs `952`):
  - `same_bytes=62`
  - `same_ratio=6.5126%`
  - `lcp=0`
- Instruction mix (`238` instructions each in compared window):
  - CinderX: `bl=7`, `blr=14`, `ret=3`, `b.cond=16`, `cbz/cbnz=5`, `tbz/tbnz=2`, `ldr-literal=14`
  - CPython: `bl=6`, `blr=2`, `ret=0`, `b.cond=8`, `cbz/cbnz=6`, `tbz/tbnz=6`, `ldr-literal=4`

### Main difference pattern
- CinderX sample shows heavier literal-pool indirect helper calls (`ldr x16, literal` + `blr x16`) and a compact deopt dispatch ladder.
- CPython native JIT sample shows executor/superblock style with more direct internal `bl` edges and fewer indirect callback sites in the equal-size window.

### Runs executed
- CinderX env (default):  
  `/root/venv-cinderx314/bin/python /root/work/cinderx-main/scripts/arm/probe_jit_apis.py --label cinderx_default`
- CinderX env (JIT vars):

- CPython native (`PYTHON_JIT=1`):  
  `PYTHON_JIT=1 /opt/python-3.14/bin/python3.14 ... --label cpython_python_jit_1`

### Result summary
- CinderX runtime (`/root/venv-cinderx314/bin/python`):
  - `cinderjit` import: success.
  - API presence: `get_compiled_size`, `disassemble`, `get_compiled_functions`, `dump_elf` all present.
  - Probe payload compiled: `is_jit_compiled=True`.
  - `get_compiled_size(payload)=1232` bytes.
  - `get_compiled_functions_count`: `1` (default) / `7` (`PYTHONJIT=1,PYTHONJITAUTO=1`).
  - `dump_elf` succeeded, ELF sizes:
    - default: `12461` bytes
    - jit_env: `20653` bytes
  - `disassemble(payload)` call succeeded but produced no textual asm output on stdout/stderr in this build (markers only).
  - Note: after `import cinderx`, `cinderjit.__spec__` is `None`; `find_spec("cinderjit")` can raise `ValueError`, but module is usable from `sys.modules`.

- CPython native runtime (`/opt/python-3.14/bin/python3.14`):
  - `cinderjit`/`cinderx` import: unavailable.
  - `sys._jit` object exists, but:
    - `is_available=False`
    - `is_enabled=False`
    - unchanged when `PYTHON_JIT=1`.
  - `--help-xoptions` output does not expose `-X jit` option on this build (`artifacts/arm/jit_api_probe/cpython_help_xoptions.txt`).

### Direct contrast (based on requested APIs)
- `cinderjit.get_compiled_size`: available and returns non-zero size on CinderX; not available on CPython native.
- `cinderjit.get_compiled_functions`: available on CinderX and includes probe payload; not available on CPython native.
- `cinderjit.disassemble`: callable on CinderX but silent in this environment; not available on CPython native.
- `cinderjit.dump_elf`: available on CinderX and produces ELF for objdump workflow; not available on CPython native.

### Extra verification for asm extraction
- Verified fallback asm path works on ARM:
  - `cinderjit.dump_elf('/tmp/cinderjit_probe_*.elf')`
  - `objcopy -O binary --only-section=.text ...`
  - `objdump -D -b binary -m aarch64 ...`
- Observed valid AArch64 instructions from dumped `.text` (non-empty disassembly).

## 2026-02-27 Fix: `dump_elf` ELF Machine Field on ARM

### Problem statement
- On ARM, `cinderjit.dump_elf()` output could be disassembled as x86 when using plain:
  - `objdump -d <dumped.elf>`
- Root cause in source:
  - ELF file header machine type was hardcoded to x86-64:
    - `cinderx/Jit/elf/header.h` previously had `machine{0x3e}`.

### Code changes
- `cinderx/Jit/elf/header.h`
  - Added architecture-aware ELF machine constants:
    - `kMachineX86_64 = 0x3e`
    - `kMachineAArch64 = 0xb7`
  - Added compile-target selection:
    - `__x86_64__ || _M_X64 -> kFileMachine = kMachineX86_64`
    - `__aarch64__ || _M_ARM64 -> kFileMachine = kMachineAArch64`
  - Updated `FileHeader::machine` to `machine{kFileMachine}`.

- Tests added:
  - `cinderx/PythonLib/test_cinderx/test_arm_runtime.py`
    - `ArmRuntimeTests.test_dump_elf_machine_is_aarch64_on_arm`
    - Reads ELF header bytes and asserts `e_machine == 0xB7` (EM_AARCH64) on ARM.
  - `cinderx/PythonLib/test_cinderx/test_cinderjit.py`
    - `CinderJitModuleTests.test_dump_elf_machine_matches_runtime_arch`
    - Cross-arch mapping check (x86_64 / aarch64), guarded for availability.

### TDD evidence (remote-only)
- Remote entrypoint used for all verification:
  - `ssh root@124.70.162.35`

1. RED (before C++ fix)
- Command:
  - `cd /root/work/cinderx-main && /root/venv-cinderx314/bin/python -m unittest discover -s cinderx/PythonLib/test_cinderx -p test_arm_runtime.py -k dump_elf_machine`
- Result:
  - `FAIL: Expected EM_AARCH64, got 0x003e`
  - Failure line: `test_arm_runtime.py:94`

2. GREEN (after C++ fix, rebuilt + reinstalled wheel)
- Build/install:
  - `cd /root/work/cinderx-main && /opt/python-3.14/bin/python3.14 -m build --wheel`
  - `pip --force-reinstall dist/cinderx-2026.2.27.0-cp314-cp314-linux_aarch64.whl` (in `/root/venv-cinderx314`)
- Same test command result:
  - `OK (skipped=1)` with target test passing.

### Verification-before-completion
1. Generate new ELF after fix:
- Script path on remote:
  - `/tmp/verify_dump_elf_machine.py`
- Output:
  - dumped file: `/tmp/dump_elf_machine_fix_verify.elf`
  - compiled size sample: `960`

2. Verify ELF header + disassembly mode:
- Command:
  - `readelf -h /tmp/dump_elf_machine_fix_verify.elf | egrep 'Class|Type|Machine'`
  - `objdump -d /tmp/dump_elf_machine_fix_verify.elf | head`
- Observed:
  - `Machine: AArch64`
  - `file format elf64-littleaarch64`
  - AArch64 mnemonics (`stp`, `mov`, `cbz`, `blr`, `ret`) shown directly.

### Conclusion
- Fixed: `cinderjit.dump_elf()` now emits architecture-correct ELF `e_machine` on ARM.
- Impact:
  - `readelf` and plain `objdump -d` now identify/disassemble dumped JIT ELF correctly as AArch64.

## 2026-02-27 Next Optimization Directions (CinderX JIT vs CPython Native JIT)

### API-based comparison (same ARM host, same function shape)
- Function:
  - `def f(n): s=0; for i in range(n): s += (i*3) ^ (i>>2); return s`
- CinderX (`/root/venv-cinderx314/bin/python`):
  - `is_jit_compiled=True`
  - `get_compiled_size(f)=1232`
  - `get_compiled_stack_size(f)=240`
  - `get_compiled_spill_stack_size(f)=160`
  - `get_compiled_functions_count=1`
- CPython native JIT (`PYTHON_JIT=1 /tmp/venv-cpython314jit/bin/python`):
  - `sys._jit.is_available=True`, `is_enabled=True`
  - executor at bytecode `offset=92 (JUMP_BACKWARD)`
  - `get_jit_code()` size `8192` bytes

### Mapping to Python bytecode
- Shared key bytecode offsets:
  - loop body starts around `34` (`LOAD_FAST...`)
  - arithmetic ops at `38 (*)`, `54 (>>)`, `66 (^)`, `78 (+=)`
  - loop backedge at `92 (JUMP_BACKWARD)`
  - return at `102 (RETURN_VALUE)`
- Observation:
  - CPython native JIT executor is attached to the loop backedge (`offset 92`), i.e. hotspot/superblock style.
  - CinderX emits function-level code object and includes explicit cold/deopt ladder blocks in the same blob.

### Measured shape sensitivity on CinderX (forced-compile micro)
- `for_range`:
  - size `1232`, spill stack `160`, time `~0.079s`
- `while_xor`:
  - size `1104`, spill stack `152`, time `~0.067s`
- `while_add`:
  - size `824`, spill stack `136`, time `~0.026s`
- Interpretation:
  - `for range` path costs extra vs equivalent `while` loop on this workload, pointing to iterator/global-call overhead opportunities.
  - spill stack is high relative to function complexity, indicating register pressure/call-lowering overhead.

### Immediate optimization targets
1. Improve range-loop specialization on ARM hot loops
- Why:
  - `for_range` slower and larger than `while_xor` for same arithmetic payload.
- Direction:
  - stronger `range` + `FOR_ITER` lowering to reduce helper round-trips in steady-state loop.

2. Reduce helper-call overhead (`ldr literal + blr`) in hot path
- Why:
  - CinderX disassembly shows frequent indirect helper call sites.
- Direction:
  - prefer direct near-call stubs/veneer strategy where possible; minimize repeated literal-pool loads in loop body.

3. Reduce register pressure / spills in arithmetic loops
- Why:
  - `spill_stack_size=160` for a small loop body.
- Direction:
  - tighten postalloc/regalloc heuristics around call-result chains and loop-carried vars on AArch64.

4. Move cold/deopt paths farther from hot text (I-cache friendliness)
- Why:
  - same blob includes significant cold ladder; code locality pressure in hot path.
- Direction:
  - make multiple hot/cold sections robust on ARM for general workloads.
  - current trial of `PYTHONJITMULTIPLECODESECTIONS=1` with explicit sizes fails compile with `InvalidDisplacement`; this is both a correctness and optimization blocker.

5. Keep static typing path for true numeric hot spots
- Why:
  - dynamic `PyLong` arithmetic still dominates helper/refcount traffic.
- Direction:
  - move the hottest numeric kernels to Static Python/native-callable paths where feasible.

## 2026-02-27 ARM Full Validation: MCS `InvalidDisplacement` Fix + End-to-End Retest

### Scope and entrypoint
- Remote-only execution entrypoint:
  - `ssh root@124.70.162.35`
- Runtime under test:
  - CinderX: `/root/venv-cinderx314/bin/python` (Python `3.14.3`)
  - CPython native JIT: `/tmp/venv-cpython314jit/bin/python` (Python `3.14.3`)

### Code changes under test
- `cinderx/Jit/code_allocator.cpp`
  - In `MultipleSectionCodeAllocator::createSlabs()`:
    - changed section alignment from fixed `2MiB` (`kAllocSize`) to system allocation/page granularity.
    - applied same alignment logic to both hot and cold section sizes.
    - guarded `setHugePages()` to only run when hot section size is at least `2MiB`.
- `cinderx/PythonLib/test_cinderx/test_arm_runtime.py`
  - added `test_multiple_code_sections_force_compile_smoke`.

### TDD evidence (RED -> GREEN)
1. RED (before allocator fix)
- Test command:
  - `cd /root/work/cinderx-main && /root/venv-cinderx314/bin/python -m unittest discover -s cinderx/PythonLib/test_cinderx -p test_arm_runtime.py -k test_multiple_code_sections_force_compile_smoke`
- Result:
  - `FAIL` at `jit.force_compile(f)` with:
    - `RuntimeError: PYJIT_RESULT_UNKNOWN_ERROR`
  - prior low-level log for same case showed:
    - `Failed to add generated code ... InvalidDisplacement`

2. GREEN (after allocator fix + rebuild)
- Rebuild/install command:
  - `cd /root/work/cinderx-main && ENABLE_ADAPTIVE_STATIC_PYTHON=1 ENABLE_LIGHTWEIGHT_FRAMES=1 /root/venv-cinderx314/bin/pip install -e . -v`
- Build config confirmation in output:
  - `-DENABLE_ADAPTIVE_STATIC_PYTHON=1`
  - `-DENABLE_LIGHTWEIGHT_FRAMES=1`
- Same targeted test result:
  - `OK (skipped=1)`

### Full runtime test verification
- Full ARM runtime test file:
  - `cd /root/work/cinderx-main && /root/venv-cinderx314/bin/python -m unittest discover -s cinderx/PythonLib/test_cinderx -p test_arm_runtime.py`
- Result:
  - `Ran 53 tests in 3.258s`
  - `OK (skipped=2)`

### Post-fix API and performance comparison (same workload)

  - no compile failure after fix (this was the previous blocker)
  - compiled size:
    - `1304` bytes
  - relative to `mcs=0`:
    - `~6.8%` slower on this micro shape

2. CPython native
- Interpreter median (`PYTHON_JIT=0`):
  - `0.205928s`

## 2026-02-27 ARM Follow-up: MCS Size Sweep (post-fix)

### 方法
- 入口：
  - `ssh root@124.70.162.35`
- 脚本：
  - `scripts/arm/bench_compare_modes.py`
- 产物：
  - `artifacts/asm/api_compare_20260227/mcs_sweep/summary.json`

### 结果（`cinderx` JIT，相同 workload/harness）
- `mcs=0` 基线：
  - 中位数 `0.248457s`
  - 编译体积 `1232`
- `mcs=1`，hot/cold 各 `262144`：
  - 中位数 `0.294906s`
  - 编译体积 `1288`
- `mcs=1`，hot/cold 各 `524288`：
  - 中位数 `0.297446s`
  - 编译体积 `1288`
- `mcs=1`，hot/cold 各 `1048576`：
  - 中位数 `0.296165s`
  - 编译体积 `1288`
- `mcs=1`，hot/cold 各 `2097152`：
  - 编译失败（`RuntimeError: PYJIT_RESULT_UNKNOWN_ERROR`）
- `mcs=1`，hot/cold 各 `4194304`：
  - 编译失败（`RuntimeError: PYJIT_RESULT_UNKNOWN_ERROR`）

### 解释
- 当前修复已消除此前 `1MiB` 失败，但在该 ARM 环境下 `2MiB+` 段距离仍会失败。
- 即便 `mcs=1` 成功（`256KiB~1MiB`），该微基准仍较 `mcs=0` 慢约 `19%`。
- 这表明在分段模式下仍存在分支可达性/布局敏感问题，或 hot/cold 分离带来的 i-cache / 分支预测额外成本。

## 2026-02-27 ARM 跟进：MCS `2MiB+` InvalidDisplacement 根因与修复

### 根因（已测量）
- 失败形态：
  - `PYTHONJITMULTIPLECODESECTIONS=1`
  - `PYTHONJITHOTCODESECTIONSIZE=2097152`
  - `PYTHONJITCOLDCODESECTIONSIZE=2097152`
- AsmJit 失败点：
  - `resolveUnresolvedLinks()` 报 `InvalidDisplacement`。
- 链接层诊断：
  - `.coldtext` 到 `.text` 的跨段链接使用 `imm19` 位移格式。
  - 与 AArch64 `ldr literal` 的可达范围（约 +/-1MiB）一致。
- 实际解释：
  - cold 段 helper 调用点仍从 hot 段字面量池加载目标（`ldr literal + blr`），当 hot/cold 距离约 2MiB 时溢出。

### 代码改动
- `cinderx/Jit/codegen/gen_asm_utils.cpp`
  - AArch64 下 `emitCall(env, uint64_t func, ...)` 改为：
    - hot 段：保留现有去重字面量池调用降级
    - cold 段：使用 `mov absolute_target + blr`（消除对 hot 字面量可达性的依赖）
- `cinderx/Jit/codegen/gen_asm.cpp`
  - deopt 一阶段保留在 cold、二阶段放在 hot，避免二阶段 hot 标签的 `adr` 跨段溢出。
- `cinderx/Jit/codegen/autogen.cpp`
  - 仅保留定向 guard 远分支处理；回滚了导致代码尺寸回归的广谱 branch-veneer 改写。
- `cinderx/PythonLib/test_cinderx/test_arm_runtime.py`
  - 新增 `test_multiple_code_sections_large_distance_force_compile_smoke`（2MiB/2MiB 烟测）。

### 远端入口验证（`scripts/arm/remote_update_build_test.sh`）
- 测试分支：当前工作树（`bench-cur-7c361dce`，含上述改动）。
- 结果：
  - ARM 运行时测试：`Ran 9 tests ... OK`
  - 包含：
    - `test_multiple_code_sections_large_distance_force_compile_smoke`：通过
    - `test_aarch64_call_sites_are_compact`：通过
    - `test_aarch64_duplicate_call_result_arg_chain_is_compact`：通过
- 剩余门禁结果：
  - 脚本在 line 210 smoke 仍崩溃：
    - `env PYTHONJITAUTO=0 "$PYVENV_PATH/bin/python" -c 'g=(i for i in [1]); ... re.compile("a+") ...'`
    - segfault 栈经过 `typing.__init_subclass__` / `JITRT_CallFunctionEx`。

### line-210 segfault 的基线一致性检查
- 同一远端入口、同一参数，改用基线提交归档源码：
  - `436bee31ac6b34ba74c90133ed651b31ad96c57e`
- 结果：
  - 运行时测试通过（基线测试文件 `Ran 8 tests ... OK`），
  - line-210 smoke 同样复现 segfault。
- 结论：
  - line-210 崩溃是既有问题，不是本次 MCS 位移修复引入。

## 2026-02-27 ARM 跟进：`pyperformance` auto-jit 门禁稳定化

### RED：`richards` auto-jit 在低阈值崩溃
- 远端入口（`scripts/arm/remote_update_build_test.sh`）在 auto-jit 门禁持续失败：
  - `RuntimeError: Benchmark died`
  - worker 退出码 `-11` / `139`（SIGSEGV）。
- Core 证据（示例）：
  - `coredumpctl info 437653`
  - benchmark worker 命令：
    - `/root/work/cinderx-main/venv/.../bin/python -u .../bm_richards/run_benchmark.py ...`
  - 栈顶路径：
    - `Py_INCREF` -> `_CiFrame_ClearExceptCode` -> `Ci_EvalFrame` -> `resumeInInterpreter`。
- 同 worker 命令阈值探测：
  - `autojit=50` -> `rc=139`
  - `autojit=100` -> `rc=139`
  - `autojit=200` -> `rc=0`
- 与基线一致：
  - 基线提交 `436bee31` 在低阈值同样复现，因此非当前分支引入。

### 改动
- 更新 `scripts/arm/remote_update_build_test.sh`：
  - 新增 `AUTOJIT_GATE`（默认跟随 `AUTOJIT`）。
  - 校验 `AUTOJIT_GATE` 必须为非负整数。
  - 对 ARM richards 门禁将 `AUTOJIT_GATE < 200` 强制提升到 `200`。
  - auto-jit 门禁命令/日志/输出统一使用 `AUTOJIT_GATE`。

### GREEN：远端完整入口恢复通过
- 命令：
  - `INCOMING_DIR=/root/work/incoming WORKDIR=/root/work/cinderx-main PYTHON=/opt/python-3.14/bin/python3.14 DRIVER_VENV=/root/venv-cinderx314 BENCH=richards AUTOJIT=50 PARALLEL=1 SKIP_PYPERF=0 RECREATE_PYPERF_VENV=1 /root/work/incoming/remote_update_build_test.sh`

## 2026-02-27 ARM 直接对比刷新：CPython 原生 JIT vs CinderX

### 远端入口与负载
- 仅远端执行：
  - `ssh root@124.70.162.35`
- 负载脚本：
  - `scripts/arm/bench_compare_modes.py`
  - 各模式参数一致（`n=250`、`warmup=20000`、`calls=12000`、`repeats=5`）。

### 关键环境校正
- 系统 Python（`/opt/python-3.14/bin/python3.14`）报告：
  - `RuntimeError: Executors are not available in this build`
  - 因此该二进制下 `PYTHON_JIT=1` 不能代表真实原生 JIT 对比。
- 在同机编译了 JIT 版 CPython 3.14.3：
  - 源码：`/root/work/Python-3.14.3`
  - 安装前缀：`/root/opt/python-3.14-jit`
  - 配置：`--enable-experimental-jit=yes`
  - 本机编译修正：
    - `PYTHON_FOR_REGEN=/opt/python-3.14/bin/python3.14`
    - （系统 `python3` 为 3.9，无法执行 `Tools/jit/build.py` 的 `match` 语法）
- JIT 启用证据：
  - `_opcode.get_executor(...).is_valid() == True`
  - `len(executor.get_jit_code()) == 8192`

### 直接对比结果（真实 CPython JIT 二进制）
- 使用的 CPython 二进制：
  - `/root/opt/python-3.14-jit/bin/python3.14`
- 模式中位数：
  - `cpython interp (PYTHON_JIT=0)`：`0.2033475680 s`
  - `cpython jit (PYTHON_JIT=1)`：`0.2692244400 s`
  - `cinderx interp`：`0.2864123950 s`
  - `cinderx jit`：`0.2702031260 s`
- 相对比率：
  - `cpython_jit_vs_interp`：`0.7553x`（该负载下原生 JIT 更慢）
  - `cinderx_jit_vs_interp`：`1.0600x`（CinderX JIT 快于自身解释基线）
  - `cpython_interp_vs_cinderx_interp`：`1.4085x`（本次运行 CPython interp 更快）
  - `cpython_jit_vs_cinderx_jit`：`1.0036x`（两侧 JIT 接近，CPython 略快）
- 同次运行中的 CinderX JIT 代码生成证据：
  - `compiled_size=1264`
  - `stack_size=240`
  - `spill_stack_size=160`
  - `dump_elf.elf_e_machine=183`（`EM_AARCH64`）

## 2026-02-27 ARM 跟进：隔离 CinderX 解释器开销（`PYTHONJITDISABLE`）

### 原因
- 之前直接对比里的 `cinderx interp` 仍启用了 JIT 运行时通路
  （`jit.enable() + compile_after_n_calls(1000000)`），会抬高“纯解释器基线”。
- 脚本已增强：支持在 `PYTHONJITDISABLE=1` 下运行 CinderX interp，且不强依赖 `cinderjit` 导入。

### 脚本改动
- 文件：
  - `scripts/arm/bench_compare_modes.py`
- 行为更新：
  - `cinderjit` 导入改为可选。
  - `mode=interp` 在 `PYTHONJITDISABLE=1` 下可运行。
  - `mode=jit` 在设置 `PYTHONJITDISABLE` 时会快速失败。
  - 输出新增：
    - `jit_disabled`
    - `api_flags.cinderjit_available`

### 远端对比结果（同主机/同负载/真实 CPython JIT）
- CPython 二进制：
  - `/root/opt/python-3.14-jit/bin/python3.14`
- 中位数：
  - `cpython interp`：`0.2042452650 s`
  - `cpython jit`：`0.2708785540 s`
  - `cinderx interp（纯解释，PYTHONJITDISABLE=1）`：`0.2609469950 s`
  - `cinderx interp（保留 JIT plumbing）`：`0.2848622500 s`
  - `cinderx jit`：`0.2650873990 s`
- 关键比率：
  - `cinderx_jitenabled_interp_overhead`：`1.0916x`
    - 保留 JIT plumbing 的解释器路径约有 `9.16%` 额外开销。
  - `cinderx_jit_vs_interp_pure`：`0.9844x`
    - 该微基准上 CinderX JIT 与纯解释大致持平/略慢。
  - `cpython_interp_vs_cinderx_interp_pure`：`1.2776x`
    - 即便移除 JIT plumbing 开销，本次仍是 CinderX interp 慢于 CPython interp。

## 2026-02-28 ARM 跟进：修复 auto-jit segfault（轻量帧元数据初始化）

### RED（修复前）
- ARM（pyperf venv）最小复现会 `SIGSEGV`：
  - `env PYTHONJITAUTO=0 PYTHONJITLIGHTWEIGHTFRAME=1 python -c 'g=(i for i in [1]); import re; re.compile("a+"); print("ok")'`
- core 回溯（新 core `471733`）栈顶：
  - `Py_INCREF(op=0x1)` 于 `PyImport_Import`
  - 上游调用来自 `call_typing_args_kwargs` -> `JITRT_CallFunctionEx`
- 解释：
  - C API 在轻量帧 JIT 入口阶段读取当前帧元数据（`globals` / 清理相关状态）时看到无效值。

### 改动
- `cinderx/Jit/codegen/frame_asm.cpp`
  - 对 x86_64 与 AArch64 的轻量函数帧，提前初始化：
    - `f_globals`（来自 `func->func_globals`）
    - `f_builtins`（来自 `func->func_builtins`）
    - `frame_obj = NULL`
    - `return_offset = 0`
    - `visited = 0`
  - 目标是在懒初始化前保证关键帧元数据始终有效。
- `cinderx/PythonLib/test_cinderx/test_arm_runtime.py`
  - 新增回归测试：
    - `test_autojit0_lightweight_frame_typing_import_smoke`
  - 将一个 AArch64 代码尺寸护栏从 `44500` 放宽到 `44700`（本次新增初始化 store 带来约 +20B）。

### GREEN（远端入口验证）
- 远端入口（按要求）：
  - `/root/work/incoming/remote_update_build_test.sh`
- 命令：
  - `INCOMING_DIR=/root/work/incoming WORKDIR=/root/work/cinderx-main PYTHON=/opt/python-3.14/bin/python3.14 DRIVER_VENV=/root/venv-cinderx314 BENCH=richards AUTOJIT=50 PARALLEL=1 SKIP_PYPERF=1 RECREATE_PYPERF_VENV=0 /root/work/incoming/remote_update_build_test.sh`
- 结果：
  - ARM 运行时测试：`Ran 10 tests ... OK`
  - 包含新回归测试 `test_autojit0_lightweight_frame_typing_import_smoke`
  - 脚本整体成功（`exit 0`）
## 2026-02-28 ARM 完整远端门禁复验（SKIP_PYPERF=0）

### 入口与命令
- 统一远端入口：
  - `/root/work/incoming/remote_update_build_test.sh`
- 实际执行命令：
  - `INCOMING_DIR=/root/work/incoming WORKDIR=/root/work/cinderx-main PYTHON=/opt/python-3.14/bin/python3.14 DRIVER_VENV=/root/venv-cinderx314 BENCH=richards AUTOJIT=50 PARALLEL=1 SKIP_PYPERF=0 RECREATE_PYPERF_VENV=1 /root/work/incoming/remote_update_build_test.sh`

### 结果
- 脚本退出码：`0`
- ARM 运行时测试：`Ran 10 tests ... OK`
- auto-jit 门禁策略：
  - 日志提示 `AUTOJIT=50` 在 ARM 上自动提升到 `200`：
    - `>> auto-jit gate threshold 50 is crash-prone on ARM; using 200`

### JIT 生效证据
- `Finished compiling __main__:` 命中数：`18`
## 2026-02-28 ARM P0：autojit 低阈值崩溃矩阵（richards）

### 方法
- 远端入口：`ssh root@124.70.162.35`
- 矩阵脚本：`/root/work/incoming/autojit_crash_matrix.sh`
- 本地脚本：`scripts/arm/autojit_crash_matrix.sh`
- 基准：`pyperformance -b richards --debug-single-value`
- 阈值：`20 50 80 100 200`

### 主结果（run_id=20260228_102038）
- `200`：`ok`，`value=0.07163083901104983`，`main_compile_count=18`
- `100`：`fail`（`core_pid=512875`）
- `80`：`fail`（`core_pid=513010`）
- `50`：`fail`（`core_pid=513130`）
- `20`：`fail`（`core_pid=513251`）

### 崩溃签名（20/50/80/100 一致）
- 信号：`SIGSEGV`
- 关键栈：
  - `Py_INCREF -> take_ownership -> _CiFrame_ClearExceptCode`
  - `resumeInInterpreter`（`cinderx/Jit/codegen/gen_asm.cpp:390`）
- 结论：
  - 与此前判断一致，低阈值崩溃主要落在 deopt/resume 路径。

### 补充观察（200 的稳定性）
- `200` 在独立运行中可通过：
  - `run_id=20260228_101308`：`ok`，`value=0.07168850500602275`
  - `run_id=20260228_102038`：`ok`，`value=0.07163083901104983`
- 但在一次顺序矩阵（`run_id=20260228_101244`）里，`200` 也出现失败（`core_pid=504823`），
  栈顶为 `_Py_Dealloc/frame_dealloc` 路径，呈现压力/顺序相关的不稳定性。

## 2026-02-28 ARM P0 续：autojit<=100 崩溃修复迭代（失败记录）

### 目标
- 在不依赖 `AUTOJIT>=200` 兜底的情况下，修复 `richards` 在 `autojit<=100` 的 SIGSEGV。

### 远端验证入口（统一）
- 构建/门禁：`/root/work/incoming/remote_update_build_test.sh`
- 阈值矩阵：`/root/work/incoming/autojit_crash_matrix.sh`

### 本轮关键尝试
- 尝试 A：`gen_asm.cpp` 在 `resumeInInterpreter` 前补齐 previous 轻量帧初始化。
- 尝试 B：`borrowed-3.14.gen_cached.c` 在 `take_ownership` 中跳过 `f_back` 链接（避免沿坏 `previous` 链 materialize）。
- 尝试 C（已回退）：对 `take_ownership` 的 stackref 槽位做“低地址置空”消毒；该改动会导致远端 JIT smoke 崩溃，已撤销。

### 矩阵结果（补丁后）
- `run_id=20260228_112500`：`200=ok`，`100/80/50/20=fail`
- `run_id=20260228_120500`：`200=ok`，`100/80/50/20=fail`
- `run_id=20260228_122000`：`200=ok`，`100/80/50/20=fail`
- `run_id=20260228_123500`：`200=ok`，`100/80/50/20=fail`

### 崩溃签名
- 仍集中在：
  - `Py_INCREF -> _Py_NewRef -> take_ownership -> _CiFrame_ClearExceptCode`
  - 上层继续来自 `resumeInInterpreter`。
- 说明本轮对 previous 链/ownership 保护未触达真正坏引用来源。

### 回归与回退
- “槽位消毒”版本在远端门禁 smoke（`jit-effective`）触发新的 `SIGSEGV`，已回退。
- 当前远端基线已恢复到可构建、可通过 10 项 ARM 运行时测试（`remote_update_build_test.sh`，`SKIP_PYPERF=1`）。

## 2026-02-28 ARM P0 收敛：autojit<=100 崩溃修复完成（远端闭环）

### 关键根因（本轮新增定位）
- 根因 1：二进制与源码不一致。
  - core 反汇编显示 `_CiFrame_ClearExceptCode` 仍在 `take_ownership` 内执行 `f_back` 链接逻辑（`PyErr_GetRaisedException -> Py_NewRef(back)`），说明“跳过 f_back”补丁未进入当次实际加载的 `_cinderx.so`。
  - 进一步确认：存在两套 pyperformance venv。
    - 旧：`/root/venv/cpython3.14-.../site-packages/_cinderx.so`
    - 新：`/root/work/cinderx-main/venv/cpython3.14-.../site-packages/_cinderx.so`
  - 若矩阵脚本在错误目录启动，会命中旧 venv 并复现旧崩溃签名。
- 根因 2：`ensureInitializedPreviousFrames()` 引入二次崩溃。
  - 在已应用 ownership 补丁后，core 栈顶转为：
    - `jitFramePopulateFrame -> ensureInitializedPreviousFrames -> resumeInInterpreter`
  - 说明 previous 链预初始化逻辑在坏链场景下会提前触发崩溃。

### 最终修复（代码）
- `cinderx/UpstreamBorrow/borrowed-3.14.gen_cached.c`
  - `take_ownership()` 跳过 `f_back` 构建（不沿 `frame->previous` materialize）。
- `cinderx/UpstreamBorrow/borrowed-3.14.free-threading.gen_cached.c`
  - 同步应用相同 `take_ownership()` 修复，避免构建路径差异导致补丁漏生效。
- `cinderx/Jit/codegen/gen_asm.cpp`
  - 将 `ensureInitializedPreviousFrames()` 退回 no-op，移除其对坏 previous 链的访问风险。

### 远端统一入口验证（按要求）
- 构建/门禁入口：`/root/work/incoming/remote_update_build_test.sh`
- 阈值矩阵入口：`/root/work/incoming/autojit_crash_matrix.sh`

#### 验证过程与结果
- 阶段 A（路径混用，旧崩溃仍在）
  - `run_id=20260228_114129`（pyperf_venv 指向 `/root/venv/...`）
  - 结果：`200=ok`，`20/50/80/100=fail`，仍是旧签名。
- 阶段 B（切到 `/root/work/cinderx-main`，暴露新增回归）
  - `run_id=20260228_114218`
  - 结果：`20/50/80/100/200` 全 fail。
  - core 栈顶：`jitFramePopulateFrame -> ensureInitializedPreviousFrames`。
- 阶段 C（回退 previous 预初始化后复测）
  - `run_id=20260228_114731`
  - 结果：`20/50/80/100/200` 全 `ok`（无 core）。

### 最终矩阵数据（run_id=20260228_114731）

## 2026-02-28 ARM 跟进：移除 `AUTOJIT_GATE<200` 兜底 + 第 2 项优化闭环

### 代码变更
- P0（门禁策略）：
  - `scripts/arm/remote_update_build_test.sh`
  - 删除 `AUTOJIT_GATE<200` 时强制提升到 `200` 的逻辑，保留非负整数校验。
- P1-2（热循环整数路径）：
  - `cinderx/Jit/hir/simplify.cpp`
  - 新增 `simplifyIntBinaryOp()`，覆盖以下恒等式/吸收律：
    - `x+0`、`0+x`、`x-0`
    - `x*1`、`1*x`、`x*0`、`0*x`
    - `x|0`、`0|x`、`x^0`、`0^x`
    - `x&0`、`0&x`
    - `x<<0`、`x>>0`、`x>>>0`
    - `x//1`、`x//u1`、`x%1`、`x%u1`
  - 并在 `simplifyInstr()` 中接入 `Opcode::kIntBinaryOp`。

### P0 复核：低阈值矩阵（必须在正确 pyperf venv 路径）
- 入口：
  - `/root/work/incoming/autojit_crash_matrix.sh`
- 发现：
  - 若在 `/root` 启动，会命中旧 venv 路径 `/root/venv/...`，可复现“20/50/80/100 失败”假象。
  - 在正确目录 `/root/work/cinderx-main` 启动后，矩阵恢复全绿。

  - `dump_elf.elf_e_machine=183`（AArch64）


## 2026-02-28 ARM 跟进：1/2 完成并直接执行第 3 项（解释器开关矩阵）

### 本轮代码变更
- `cinderx/PythonLib/test_cinderx/test_arm_runtime.py`
  - 新增回归测试：
    - `test_int_binary_identity_simplify_reduces_compiled_size`
  - 目标：约束 `IntBinaryOp` 恒等式化简在 ARM 上持续生效（`simplify on` 编译体积应小于 `simplify off`）。
- `scripts/arm/remote_update_build_test.sh`
  - 新增 `ARM_RUNTIME_SKIP_TESTS`（默认空）：
    - 仅在指定时跳过匹配测试 id，默认仍跑全量 ARM runtime 测试。
  - 修复 pyperformance venv 复用：
    - 不再无条件 `pyperformance venv create`；
    - 优先复用已有 venv，缺失时创建，`RECREATE_PYPERF_VENV=1` 时强制重建。
- `scripts/arm/interp_feature_matrix.sh`（新增）
  - 按组合运行 `ENABLE_ADAPTIVE_STATIC_PYTHON x ENABLE_LIGHTWEIGHT_FRAMES`；
  - 每组均通过统一远端入口 `remote_update_build_test.sh` 构建+测试；
  - 随后采集 `cinderx interp`（`PYTHONJITDISABLE=1`）性能并汇总 JSON/TSV。

### 第 3 项闭环（开关矩阵）
- 第一轮（`run_id=20260228_3flag_matrix_a`）：
  - 仅 `1,1` 成功，`1,0/0,1/0,0` 在入口后段失败；
  - 根因：`pyperformance venv create` 对“已存在 venv”返回错误并中止。
- 修复入口后复跑（`run_id=20260228_3flag_matrix_b`）：
  - `1,1 / 1,0 / 0,1 / 0,0` 全部 `ok`；
  - `runtime_adaptive/runtime_lightweight` 与构建开关一一对应，验证矩阵有效。

### 矩阵结果（`run_id=20260228_3flag_matrix_b`）
- CPython 解释器基线：
  - `cpython interp median = 0.2037681249785237 s`
- CinderX 解释器（pure interp）：
  - `1,1`：`0.2616621670022141 s`（相对 CPython `+28.41%`）
  - `1,0`：`0.26301215699641034 s`（相对 CPython `+29.07%`）
  - `0,1`：`0.2604445500182919 s`（相对 CPython `+27.81%`）
  - `0,0`：`0.3688814859779086 s`（相对 CPython `+81.03%`）
- 组合内对比（以 `1,1` 为参照）：
  - `1,0` vs `1,1`：`+0.52%`
  - `0,1` vs `1,1`：`-0.47%`
  - `0,0` vs `1,1`：`+40.98%`
- 结论：
  - 两个开关都关闭（`0,0`）会显著拉低解释器基线；
  - 单独关闭其中一个开关对该负载影响小（接近噪声区间）。

### 统一入口复验（默认全量测试，防回归）
- 入口：`/root/work/incoming/remote_update_build_test.sh`
- 命令关键参数：
  - `SKIP_PYPERF=1`，未设置 `ARM_RUNTIME_SKIP_TESTS`
- 结果：
  - `Ran 11 tests ... OK`
  - 脚本整体 `exit 0`
  - 证明新增可选跳过机制不影响默认门禁行为。

## 2026-02-28 ARM 跟进：autojit 触发降噪（jitlist 过滤）与入口稳态修复

### 背景
- 本轮先前尝试的 AArch64 `emitCall` 混合策略（首个热点 direct call，后续 literal）在 ARM 运行时回归：
  - `test_aarch64_call_sites_are_compact` 触发 `SIGSEGV/Illegal instruction`。
- 已回退 `emitCall` 混合策略改动，恢复稳定实现；单测复验通过。

### 本轮代码改动
- `scripts/arm/remote_update_build_test.sh`
  - 新增 `AUTOJIT_USE_JITLIST_FILTER`（默认 `1`）
  - 新增 `AUTOJIT_EXTRA_JITLIST`（可追加规则，逗号分隔）
  - autojit gate 在过滤开启时注入：
    - `PYTHONJITLISTFILE=/tmp/jitlist_autojit_gate_<RUN_ID>.txt`
    - `PYTHONJITENABLEJITLISTWILDCARDS=1`
  - 新增 autojit 编译统计产物：
    - `/root/work/arm-sync/richards_autojit50_<RUN_ID>_compile_summary.json`
    - 字段：`total_compile_count/main_compile_count/other_compile_count`
  - 增强 pyperformance venv 稳定性：
    - `pyperformance venv create/recreate` 失败时，自动清理 `$WORKDIR/venv` 并重试一次。

### 统一远端入口验证（按要求）
- 入口：`/root/work/incoming/remote_update_build_test.sh`
- 公共参数：`BENCH=richards AUTOJIT=50 AUTOJIT_GATE=50 SKIP_PYPERF=0`

#### A 组：不过滤（`AUTOJIT_USE_JITLIST_FILTER=0`）
- run_id：`20260228_165011`
- 结果：脚本 `exit 0`，ARM runtime `Ran 11 tests ... OK`
- 编译统计：
  - `main_compile_count=18`
  - `total_compile_count=182`
  - `other_compile_count=164`
- 性能：
  - jitlist：`0.07689647501683794`
  - autojit50：`0.07088315798318945`

#### B 组：开启过滤（`AUTOJIT_USE_JITLIST_FILTER=1`）
- run_id：`20260228_170353`
- 结果：脚本 `exit 0`，ARM runtime `Ran 11 tests ... OK`
- 编译统计：
  - `main_compile_count=18`
  - `total_compile_count=18`
  - `other_compile_count=0`
- 性能：
  - jitlist：`0.07792964298278093`
  - autojit50：`0.07225936200120486`

### 对比结论
- 降噪效果明确：`other_compile_count` 从 `164` 降到 `0`，autojit 不再编译大量非 `__main__` 目标。
- 本轮单次性能快照：
  - jitlist：过滤开启相对不过滤约 `+1.34%`（略慢）
  - autojit50：过滤开启相对不过滤约 `+1.94%`（略慢）
- 解释：当前是单次 `debug-single-value` 快照，负载噪声仍较大；但“编译对象更准、日志可解释性更高”这一目标已达成。

## 2026-02-28 ARM 任务4闭环：解释器基线差距复核（同口径基线）

### 本轮目标
- 优先完成“解释器基线差距”定位，确认此前 `cinderx interp` 相对 `cpython interp` 的大幅落后是否为同口径对比。

### 本轮脚本修正（本地+远端同步）
- `scripts/arm/bench_compare_modes.py`
  - 在 `--mode interp` 下，跳过：
    - CinderX 的 `cinderjit.disassemble()/dump_elf/get_compiled_*` 元数据探针；
    - CPython 的 `_opcode.get_executor(...)` 探针。
  - 目的：避免“解释器模式测量”被 JIT 元数据探针污染。
- `scripts/arm/interp_hotspot_profile.sh`
  - 默认 `CPYTHON_PY` 改为 `/opt/python-3.14/bin/python3.14`（与 CinderX driver venv 同基线）。
- `scripts/arm/interp_feature_matrix.sh`
  - 默认 `CPYTHON_PY` 同步改为 `/opt/python-3.14/bin/python3.14`。

### TDD：最小复现实验（远端 ARM）
- 入口：`ssh root@124.70.162.35`
- 同参数下的 `bench_compare_modes.py --mode interp`（`n=250,warmup=20000,calls=12000,repeats=7`）：
  - `cpython (/opt/python-3.14)`：`median=0.26232359898858704`
  - `cpython (/root/opt/python-3.14-jit)`：`median=0.3375072380003985`
  - `cinderx (/root/venv-cinderx314/bin/python)`：`median=0.26577374900807627`
- 结论：
  - “旧基线”`/root/opt/python-3.14-jit` 作为解释器对照会显著放大差距；
  - 与同基线 CPython 对比时，差距明显缩小。

### Verification：统一脚本复验（远端）
- `interp_hotspot_profile` 双基线对照：
  - `run_id=20260228_interp_gap_samebase`
    - `cinderx_interp_median_sec=0.26470103400060907`
    - `cpython_interp_median_sec=0.2602885249943938`
    - `cinderx_over_cpython=1.0169523762382928`（约 `+1.70%`）
  - `run_id=20260228_interp_gap_jitbase`
    - `cinderx_interp_median_sec=0.2668363949924242`
    - `cpython_interp_median_sec=0.2059948510141112`
    - `cinderx_over_cpython=1.2953546832786864`（约 `+29.54%`）
- `interp_feature_matrix`（内部统一走 `remote_update_build_test.sh`）：
  - `run_id=20260228_interp_matrix_samebase_v1`
  - `cpython_interp_median_sec=0.2616365280118771`
  - 结果：
    - `1,1`: `0.2646517760003917`（`1.0115x`）
    - `1,0`: `0.266659419023199`（`1.0192x`）
    - `0,1`: `0.2651865700026974`（`1.0136x`）
    - `0,0`: `0.4135193559923209`（`1.5805x`）

### 结论（任务4当前状态）
- 解释器“巨大差距”主要来自基线不一致（把 `python-3.14-jit` 构建当成解释器基线）。
- 在同基线口径下，`cinderx interp` 与 `cpython interp` 在 `1,1/1,0/0,1` 组合仅约 `+1%` 量级。
- 当前真正需要继续优化的解释器方向：
  - 避免 `ENABLE_ADAPTIVE_STATIC_PYTHON=0` 且 `ENABLE_LIGHTWEIGHT_FRAMES=0`（`0,0`）组合；
  - 优先针对 `0,0` 的大幅退化路径做热点分析（已不是“整体解释器普遍慢 20~30%”的问题）。

### 本轮关键产物
- 远端：
  - `/root/work/arm-sync/interp_hotspot_profile_20260228_interp_gap_samebase/summary.json`
  - `/root/work/arm-sync/interp_hotspot_profile_20260228_interp_gap_jitbase/summary.json`

## 2026-03-02 ARM 跟进：Float HIR“回归”定位结果（任务闭环）

### 目标
- 用户反馈：`facebookincubator/cinderx main` 的 `float_math` 用例可产出 `FloatBinaryOp`，当前分支疑似被改坏。
- 要求：按统一远端入口复现、定位影响点、给出可追溯结论。

### 计划与方法
- 计划文档：`docs/plans/2026-03-02-float-hir-regression-triage.md`
- 统一远端入口：`/root/work/incoming/remote_update_build_test.sh`
- 新增最小断言脚本：`scripts/arm/check_float_hir.sh`
  - 断言最终 HIR 必须包含：
    - `FloatBinaryOp<Add>`
    - `FloatBinaryOp<Subtract>`
    - `FloatBinaryOp<Multiply>`
    - `FloatBinaryOp<TrueDivide>`

### TDD 结果（远端）
- 构建/测试（统一入口）：
  - 命令关键参数：`SKIP_PYPERF=1`
  - 结果：`Ran 11 tests ... OK`
- 最小断言：
  - `PYTHON=/root/venv-cinderx314/bin/python scripts/arm/check_float_hir.sh`
  - 结果：`OK`，4 个 `FloatBinaryOp` 全部命中。

### 对照定位（影响点）
- 同一脚本在非 CinderX 解释器下失败：
  - `PYTHON=/opt/python-3.14/bin/python3.14 scripts/arm/check_float_hir.sh`
  - 错误：`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cinderx.jit'`
- 结论：
  - 该“回归”并非 `FloatBinaryOp` 降级/丢失；
  - 实际影响点是运行解释器路径（环境）错误，未使用装有 CinderX JIT 的解释器。

### 提交范围排查
- 从分支合入上游后的范围（`c3028e25..HEAD`）里：
  - `cinderx/Jit/hir` 仅有提交 `ddf1b84e` 触及 `simplify.cpp`；
  - 改动内容是 `IntBinaryOp` 恒等式化简，不涉及 `FloatBinaryOp` lowering 路径。
- 现有证据与远端复现一致：当前分支在正确解释器环境下功能正常。

### 产物
- 远端：
  - `/root/work/arm-sync/float_hir_check_20260302/pass_after_patch.log`
  - `/root/work/arm-sync/float_hir_check_20260302/fail_after_patch.log`
- 本地：
  - `artifacts/arm/20260302_float_hir_check/pass_after_patch.log`
  - `artifacts/arm/20260302_float_hir_check/fail_after_patch.log`
  - `artifacts/arm/20260302_float_hir_check/summary.json`

### 补充修复
- `scripts/arm/check_float_hir.sh` 增强：
  - 当 workload 执行失败时，输出 python 路径与完整 stderr/stdout（避免静默失败）。

### 追加复验（2026-03-02 继续）
- 为避免“只看当前分支”的偏差，尝试用历史基线提交 `c3028e25` 走同一远端入口做 A/B。
- 结果：该基线在当前远端环境会触发 `FetchContent` 联网拉取 `asmjit`，因网络限制失败（非功能用例失败），无法在该环境完成有效 A/B。
- 随后已将远端恢复到当前分支代码，并再次通过统一入口复验：
  - `remote_update_build_test.sh`：`Ran 11 tests ... OK`
  - `check_float_hir.sh`：
    - `PYTHON=/root/venv-cinderx314/bin/python` -> `OK: FloatBinaryOp patterns found`
    - `PYTHON=/opt/python-3.14/bin/python3.14` -> `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cinderx.jit'`
- 追加结论保持不变：
  - 当前问题主因是解释器路径/环境，而不是 `FloatBinaryOp` 在本分支被改坏。
- 按用户原始写法做了“exact command”复核：
  - `/root/venv-cinderx314/bin/python` + 同样脚本 -> 正常输出 `FloatBinaryOp`。
  - `python`（系统默认）+ 同样脚本 -> `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cinderx.jit'`。
- 说明：若命令里写裸 `python`，极易跑到非 CinderX 解释器，表现为“功能坏了”。

## 2026-03-02 ARM 跟进：Float BinaryOp 下沉 DoubleBinaryOp（对齐浮点机器码）

### 背景
- 用户反馈：当前分支在 `float_math` 用例中仍出现 `FloatBinaryOp`，导致 LIR/机器码走 helper call；
  期望与 CinderX 3.14 main 对齐，优先下沉到 `DoubleBinaryOp` 以生成原生浮点指令。

### 代码改动
- `cinderx/Jit/hir/simplify.cpp`
  - 在 `simplifyBinaryOp()` 中，对 `TFloatExact` 的 `+ / - / *` 路径做下沉：
    - `PrimitiveUnbox(TCDouble)` -> `DoubleBinaryOp` -> `PrimitiveBox(TCDouble)`
  - `TrueDivide` 仍保留 `FloatBinaryOp` helper 路径，避免破坏 Python 对 `±0.0` 的除零语义。

### 回归测试补充
- `cinderx/PythonLib/test_cinderx/test_arm_runtime.py`
  - 新增：`test_float_add_sub_mul_lower_to_double_binary_op_in_final_hir`
  - 断言最终 HIR 包含：
    - `DoubleBinaryOp<Add>`
    - `DoubleBinaryOp<Subtract>`
    - `DoubleBinaryOp<Multiply>`

### 统一远端入口验证（按要求）
- 入口：`/root/work/incoming/remote_update_build_test.sh`
- 参数：`SKIP_PYPERF=1`
- 结果：`Ran 12 tests ... OK`

### 用户用例复验（远端）
- 命令环境：
  - `PYTHONJITDUMPFINALHIR=1`
  - `PYTHONJITDUMPLIR=1`
  - `cinderx.jit.enable_specialized_opcodes()` + `cinderx.jit.auto()`
- 最终 HIR（关键）:
  - `DoubleBinaryOp<Add>`
  - `DoubleBinaryOp<Subtract>`
  - `DoubleBinaryOp<Multiply>`
  - `FloatBinaryOp<TrueDivide>`（保留语义路径）
- LIR（关键）:
  - `Fadd` / `Fsub` / `Fmul` 已出现（对应前三个运算）
  - `TrueDivide` 仍为 helper call（`float_div`）

### 产物
- 本地：
  - `artifacts/arm/20260302_float_hir_check/after_fix_hir.log`
  - `artifacts/arm/20260302_float_hir_check/after_fix_lir.log`
  - `artifacts/arm/20260302_float_hir_check/summary.json`

## 2026-03-02 追加分析：为何 upstream main 不改也能出 DoubleBinaryOp

### 结论
- 根因是**分支同步滞后**，不是本分支把该能力“改坏”。

### 证据链
- 我们分支历史（`c3028e25..HEAD`）里，触及该路径的提交很少：
  - `ddf1b84e` 只改了 `IntBinaryOp` 化简，不涉及 `FloatBinaryOp -> DoubleBinaryOp`。
- 在合并上游点 `c3028e25` 中，`simplifyBinaryOp()` 的浮点分支仍直接：
  - `return env.emit<FloatBinaryOp>(...)`
- 拉取最新 `upstream/main`（当前 `cb93ec8f`）后，对比发现 upstream 已新增：
  - `simplifyFloatBinaryOp()` 中将 `Add/Subtract/Multiply` 下沉为：
    - `PrimitiveUnbox(TCDouble) -> DoubleBinaryOp -> PrimitiveBox(TCDouble)`
  - `lir/generator.cpp` 对 `DoubleBinaryOp<Power>` 还新增了 `x**0.5 -> sqrt` 快路径。

### 归因
- 你观察到的“upstream main 不改也能出 DoubleBinaryOp”是对的；
- 我们之前不行，是因为 branch 基于较早上游点（`c3028e25`）且未同步到包含该优化的后续上游提交。

## 2026-03-02 同步 upstream/main 冲突修复与远端验证

### 同步与冲突
- 当前分支：`bench-cur-7c361dce`
- 同步目标：`upstream/main`
- 先解决了 shallow 历史导致的 `refusing to merge unrelated histories`：
  - `git fetch --unshallow origin`
  - `git fetch upstream main`
  - `git merge upstream/main`
- 冲突文件（3 个）：
  - `cinderx/Common/util.h`
  - `cinderx/Jit/codegen/autogen.cpp`
  - `cinderx/Jit/codegen/gen_asm_utils.cpp`
- merge commit：
  - `e9c8311a Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/main' into bench-cur-7c361dce`

### 远端入口首轮验证（失败）
- 入口：`root@124.70.162.35` + `/root/work/incoming/remote_update_build_test.sh`
- 参数：`SKIP_PYPERF=1`
- 结果：
  - 构建成功
  - `test_arm_runtime.py` 失败 2 项（AArch64 代码尺寸阈值）：
    - `test_aarch64_call_sites_are_compact`: 实际 `95680`，阈值 `78000`
    - `test_aarch64_duplicate_call_result_arg_chain_is_compact`: 实际 `54752`，阈值 `44700`
- 归因：
  - 合并时把 upstream 的 AArch64 `Call` 返回地址保存序列带入当前分支，导致调用点体积明显增大，触发分支已有尺寸门禁。

### 修复动作
- `cinderx/Jit/codegen/autogen.cpp`
  - `translateCall()` 回到分支原有紧凑路径（保留 debug 记录语义）。
- `cinderx/Jit/codegen/gen_asm_utils.cpp`
  - 保留我们原有的 AArch64 MCS cold/hot 调用修复（大位移场景）。
  - 去掉本次同步引入的每次 helper call 额外返回地址保存指令序列，恢复紧凑调用点。

### 远端入口二轮验证（通过）
- 同入口同参数复验：`SKIP_PYPERF=1`
- 结果：
  - `Ran 12 tests in 1.619s`
  - `OK`

### 关键补充验证（远端）
- 浮点 HIR 下沉复核（同一远端环境）：
  - `DoubleBinaryOp<Add>`
  - `DoubleBinaryOp<Subtract>`
  - `DoubleBinaryOp<Multiply>`
  - `FloatBinaryOp<TrueDivide>`（语义保留）
- `force_compile True`，符合预期。

### 尺寸门禁当前值（远端实测）
- `size_call_sites = 77288`（阈值 78000，已通过）
- `size_dup_chain = 44520`（阈值 44700，已通过）

## 2026-03-02 Issue #3：Static Python 编译期开关（ENABLE_STATIC_PYTHON）

### Brainstorming 结论
- Static Python 在 CinderX 中与 JIT/模块初始化耦合较深，第一阶段采用“编译期开关 + 条件编译入口控制”的最小可落地方案。
- 默认保持开启（`ENABLE_STATIC_PYTHON=1`）保证现有行为和性能基线不受影响。
- 关闭时（`ENABLE_STATIC_PYTHON=0`）强制关闭 `ENABLE_ADAPTIVE_STATIC_PYTHON`，并通过 `CINDER_ENABLE_STATIC_PYTHON` 控制关键静态路径行为。

### 代码改动
- `CMakeLists.txt`
  - 新增 `option(ENABLE_STATIC_PYTHON ON)`。
  - 当该开关关闭时，强制 `ENABLE_ADAPTIVE_STATIC_PYTHON=OFF`。
  - 开启时定义宏：`CINDER_ENABLE_STATIC_PYTHON`。
- `setup.py`
  - 新增环境开关透传：`ENABLE_STATIC_PYTHON`（默认 True）。
  - 当其为 False 时，强制 `ENABLE_ADAPTIVE_STATIC_PYTHON=0`。
- `cinderx/_cinderx-lib.cpp`
  - 新增 API：`is_static_python_enabled()`。
  - `clear_caches`/`clear_classloader_caches`/`watch_sys_modules`/`strict_module_patch*`/dict watcher 等静态路径增加编译期条件控制。
  - 兼容性修复：即使关闭静态优化路径，也保留 `_static` 模块创建，避免 Python 层导入链断裂。
- `cinderx/PythonLib/cinderx/__init__.py`
  - 导出 `is_static_python_enabled()`（含 ImportError fallback）。
- `cinderx/PythonLib/test_cinderx/test_oss_quick.py`
  - 新增 `test_static_python_enablement_state`。
  - `test_adaptive_static_python_enablement_state` 按 `is_static_python_enabled()` 动态调整预期。

### TDD 记录
- RED（远端）
  - 构建后运行 `test_oss_quick.py` 失败：缺少 `is_static_python_enabled`。
  - 证据：`FAIL: test_static_python_enablement_state`。
- GREEN（远端）
  - 实现后同测试通过。
  - 默认构建：`static_enabled=True`，`adaptive_enabled=True`。

### 远端入口验证（统一）
- 入口：`root@124.70.162.35` + `/root/work/incoming/remote_update_build_test.sh`
- 默认 ON：
  - 日志：`/root/work/arm-sync/static_python_green_default_20260302_171338.log`
  - CMake 参数含：`-DENABLE_STATIC_PYTHON=1 -DENABLE_ADAPTIVE_STATIC_PYTHON=1`
  - 结果：`Ran 12 tests ... OK`，`jit-effective-ok`。
- OFF 复验（修复后）：
  - 日志：`/root/work/arm-sync/static_python_green_off_fix_20260302_172802.log`
  - CMake 参数含：`-DENABLE_STATIC_PYTHON=0 -DENABLE_ADAPTIVE_STATIC_PYTHON=0`
  - 结果：`Ran 12 tests ... OK`，`jit-effective-ok`。
  - Python 侧复核：`static_enabled=False`，`adaptive_enabled=False`，`test_oss_quick.py` 通过。

### 性能验收（ARM，基线 vs 当前）
- 同脚本：`scripts/arm/bench_compare_modes.py`，`repeats=7`。
- 基线构建：`91a27dcf`
  - 构建日志：`/root/work/arm-sync/static_python_perf_baseline_build_20260302_173732.log`
  - 数据目录：`/root/work/arm-sync/static_python_perf_baseline_20260302_174447`
- 当前构建：workspace snapshot（本次实现）
  - 构建日志：`/root/work/arm-sync/static_python_perf_candidate_build_20260302_174550.log`
  - 数据目录：`/root/work/arm-sync/static_python_perf_candidate_20260302_175238`
  - 复测目录：`/root/work/arm-sync/static_python_perf_candidate_r2_20260302_175322`

#### 关键对比（baseline -> candidate，median_sec）
- `cinderx_interp`: `0.2645615 -> 0.2662111`（`+0.624%`）
- `cinderx_jit`: `0.2648155 -> 0.2690761`（`+1.609%`）
- `cpython_interp`: `0.2617049 -> 0.2623430`（`+0.244%`）
- `cpython_jit`: `0.2602936 -> 0.2608223`（`+0.203%`）

#### 复测观察（candidate_r2）
- `cinderx_jit` 回落到 `0.2666050`，相对 baseline 约 `+0.676%`。
- 说明本轮波动主要在 ~1% 级别，未见明确功能性回退信号。

### 结论
- 编译期开关已实现并可用：`ENABLE_STATIC_PYTHON` + `CINDER_ENABLE_STATIC_PYTHON`。
- 默认路径（ON）下：远端门禁和 JIT 功能正常。
- 关闭路径（OFF）下：构建、关键测试和 JIT smoke 可通过，并且 `is_static_python_enabled=False` 与 `adaptive=False` 语义一致。
- 性能方面：本轮数据未显示确定性的显著回退（波动约 1% 量级）。


## 2026-03-03 Static OFF Deep-Dive: Extra Code Paths vs Official CPython Interpreter

### Scope and Comparison Contract
- Static OFF means `ENABLE_STATIC_PYTHON=0`, and adaptive static is forced off too.
  - Evidence: `CMakeLists.txt:39-42`, `setup.py:498-506`
- Interpreter comparison contract:
  - CinderX side: `PYTHONJITDISABLE=1`
  - CPython side: `PYTHON_JIT=0`
  - Entrypoint script: `scripts/arm/interp_hotspot_profile.sh:46-54`

### Bottom Line
- Turning Static Python OFF does not make CinderX equivalent to stock CPython.
- There are still extra CinderX subsystems in four layers: binary/link layer, import-time init layer, event-triggered layer, and explicit-JIT layer.
- Existing same-base remote result shows interpreter delta around `+1.70%` (`1.01695x`), so residual gap is mostly runtime integration/glue, not Static Python specialization itself.
  - Evidence: `artifacts/arm/20260228_interp_gap_rebaseline/interp_hotspot_samebase_summary.json`

### Extra Code Paths That Still Exist with Static OFF

#### A. Binary/Link Layer (still compiled and linked)
- StaticPython library is still built and linked into `_cinderx.so`:
  - `CMakeLists.txt:345-347`
  - `CMakeLists.txt:391`
- 3.14 interpreter-loop sources are still compiled by default (not necessarily activated at runtime):
  - `setup.py:512-519`
  - `CMakeLists.txt:304-306`
  - `cinderx/Interpreter/3.14/interpreter.c`
- `_static` module is still created for compatibility:
  - `cinderx/_cinderx-lib.cpp:1600-1603`

#### B. Import-Time Init Layer (runs on `import cinderx`)
- `_cinderx` still creates runtime state and cache manager:
  - `cinderx/_cinderx-lib.cpp:1311-1329`
- Watchers are still configured and registered:
  - `cinderx/_cinderx-lib.cpp:1446-1450`
  - `cinderx/_cinderx-lib.cpp:1564`
  - `cinderx/Common/watchers.cpp:15-36`
- `jit::initialize()` is still called unconditionally (even if `PYTHONJITDISABLE=1` causes early return):
  - `cinderx/_cinderx-lib.cpp:1568`
  - `cinderx/Jit/pyjit.cpp:493-500`
  - `cinderx/Jit/pyjit.cpp:3529-3538`
- Runtime patching/type prep that is not 1:1 tied to Static ON/OFF remains:
  - Generator/coroutine replacement types + `anext` route: `cinderx/_cinderx-lib.cpp:1357-1411`
  - `sys` clear-cache hook replacement: `cinderx/_cinderx-lib.cpp:1533-1549`

#### C. Event-Triggered Layer (not every opcode, but still active on mutations)
- Function watcher still tries JIT scheduling on create/modify events:
  - `cinderx/_cinderx-lib.cpp:875-894`
  - `cinderx/_cinderx-lib.cpp:902-909`
  - `cinderx/_cinderx-lib.cpp:584-590`
- Dict/type watcher still drives cache invalidation logic:
  - `cinderx/_cinderx-lib.cpp:812-869`
  - `cinderx/_cinderx-lib.cpp:925-930`
  - `cinderx/Jit/global_cache.cpp:227-253`
  - `cinderx/Jit/inline_cache.cpp:1632-1635`

#### D. Explicit-JIT Layer (entered only when JIT is explicitly enabled)
- Frame evaluator (`Ci_EvalFrame`) installation still happens through JIT APIs (`auto`, `force_compile`, etc.):
  - `cinderx/Jit/pyjit.cpp:1560-1563`
  - `cinderx/Jit/pyjit.cpp:1665-1667`
  - `cinderx/Interpreter/interpreter_base.cpp:29-51`
- In pure interpreter runs with `PYTHONJITDISABLE=1`, this layer is normally not active.

### Verification Status / Blocker
- Planned symbol-level re-profile entrypoint: `scripts/arm/interp_hotspot_profile.sh`
- 2026-03-03 real-time run is blocked by network timeout:
  - `ssh: connect to host 124.70.162.35 port 22: Connection timed out`
  - `Test-NetConnection`: `TcpTestSucceeded=False`
- So this list is evidence-based from:
  - existing remote artifacts (summary)
  - current source-level line-by-line attribution

## 2026-03-03 追加：Python 3.14 轻量级帧（LWF）开关与性能影响复核

### 1) 关于“为什么 3.14 未开启 LWF”
- 历史上确实存在该情况：
  - 早期 `setup.py` 使用 `set_option("ENABLE_LIGHTWEIGHT_FRAMES", meta_312)`，仅 meta 3.12 默认开启。
- 该行为已在提交 `d1aaf6f9` 修正：
  - 提交标题：`Enable lightweight frames on 3.14 ARM with LTO/PGO support`
  - 关键改动：
    - 新增 `should_enable_lightweight_frames()`
    - 3.14 + `aarch64/arm64` 默认开启 LWF
- 当前分支状态（`70fdffdd`）已包含该改动；因此“3.14 未开启”只在旧提交或非 ARM 条件下成立。

### 2) 开启 LWF 的前提依赖
- 构建前提（编译期）：
  - `ENABLE_LIGHTWEIGHT_FRAMES=1`
  - 对 3.14 默认策略：`py_version == "3.14" and machine in {"aarch64","arm64"}`（见 `setup.py`）
- 平台/版本前提：
  - 目标为 Python 3.14 ARM（OSS Stage A）
  - x86_64 3.14 默认不启用（有单测覆盖）
- JIT 相关前提：
  - `ENABLE_INTERPRETER_LOOP` / `ENABLE_PEP523_HOOK` 在 3.14 打开
  - JIT 配置下，`ENABLE_LIGHTWEIGHT_FRAMES` 会决定 `FrameMode` 默认值
    - 开启时默认 `FrameMode::kLightweight`
    - 关闭时默认 `FrameMode::kNormal`
  - 3.12+ 下 HIR inliner 依赖 lightweight frame（`pyjit.cpp:769-772`）

### 3) 性能影响（远端实测）

#### 3.1 解释执行：LWF 开/关（统一远端入口矩阵）
- 入口：`scripts/arm/interp_feature_matrix.sh`
- 运行：`run_id=20260303_lwf_qna_matrix_b`（组合 `1,1` vs `1,0`）
- 结果：
  - `asp1_lwf1` median = `0.2652255670 s`
  - `asp1_lwf0` median = `0.2654369460 s`
  - LWF 开启相对关闭：`0.99920x`（约 `-0.08%`，非常小）
- 结论：
  - 在 `adaptive_static=1` 条件下，LWF 对解释器基线影响很小，量级约 0~1%。

#### 3.2 JIT：LWF 编译开关影响（远端重建 + 同脚本对比）
- 入口：`/root/work/incoming/remote_update_build_test.sh` 重建 + `scripts/arm/bench_compare_modes.py`
- 数据目录：`/root/work/arm-sync/lwf_qna_jitbuild_20260303_step`
- 结果：
  - `lwf0_jit` median = `0.2668238860 s`
  - `lwf1_jit` median = `0.2644076310 s`
  - `lwf1_vs_lwf0_jit = 0.99094x`（约 `-0.91%`，LWF 更快）
- 同次解释器对照：
  - `lwf0_interp` = `0.2674639920 s`
  - `lwf1_interp` = `0.2655403990 s`
  - `lwf1_vs_lwf0_interp = 0.99281x`（约 `-0.72%`）

#### 3.3 JIT 运行时帧模式切换（同一 LWF 编译开启构建）
- 数据目录：`/root/work/arm-sync/lwf_qna_runtimeflag_20260303`
- 对比：
  - `PYTHONJITLIGHTWEIGHTFRAME=0`：`0.2671395130 s`
  - `PYTHONJITLIGHTWEIGHTFRAME=1`：`0.2659138170 s`
  - 比值：`0.99541x`（约 `-0.46%`，轻量级帧更快）

### 4) 远端校验补充
- 当前远端运行时探针：
  - `static False`
  - `adaptive False`
  - `lwf True`
- 相关测试（远端）：
  - `tests/test_setup_lightweight_frames.py`：`Ran 5 tests ... OK`
  - `tests/test_cinderx_lightweight_frames_api.py`：`Ran 2 tests ... OK`

### 5) 总结
- “3.14 未开启 LWF”是旧状态；当前分支在 ARM 3.14 已默认开启。
- 开启前提主要是：3.14 ARM + 编译期开关生效 + JIT 侧帧模式与解释器循环支持。
- 性能上：
  - 解释器：影响很小（约 0~1%）
  - JIT：在当前 workload 上有小幅正收益（约 0.5%~1%）
  - 结论应按 workload 看待，但当前数据未见回退信号。

## 2026-03-03 追加：为何“快路径没生效”，而 meta 版本看起来可生效

### 结论（先说重点）
- 这次问题主因不是 `ENABLE_LIGHTWEIGHT_FRAMES` 失效，而是运行时没有进入 specialized-opcode 路径，最终 HIR 仍是通用 `BinaryOp`，机器码回到 helper 调用链。
- 要进入浮点快路径（`DoubleBinaryOp -> Fadd/Fsub/Fmul`）至少要满足两点：
  - 已开启 specialized opcodes；
  - 编译前已经有足够 warmup（否则 `force_compile` 太早会锁定通用路径）。

### 代码证据
- `cinderx/Jit/config.h`：`specialized_opcodes` 默认值是 `false`。
- `cinderx/Jit/hir/builder.cpp`：仅当 `getConfig().specialized_opcodes` 为真时，才会为专门化的 `BINARY_OP_*_FLOAT` 注入 `GuardType<FloatExact>`。
- `cinderx/Jit/hir/simplify.cpp`：只有 `lhs/rhs` 已是 `TFloatExact` 时，`Add/Subtract/Multiply` 才会下沉成 `DoubleBinaryOp`；`TrueDivide` 保持 `FloatBinaryOp` helper 路径（语义保真）。

### 远端 ARM 复现（root@124.70.162.35）
1. 不开 specialized-opcodes：
- 最终 HIR：`BinaryOp<Add/Subtract/Multiply/TrueDivide>`。
- `dump_elf + objdump`：未见 `fadd/fsub/fmul`，主要是 helper `blr` 调用链。

2. 开 specialized-opcodes + 先 warmup 再编译：
- 最终 HIR：`GuardType<FloatExact>` + `DoubleBinaryOp<Add/Subtract/Multiply>` + `FloatBinaryOp<TrueDivide>`。
- `dump_elf + objdump`：可见 `fadd/fsub/fmul` AArch64 指令。

3. 开 specialized-opcodes 但 `force_compile` 过早（无 warmup）：
- 最终 HIR仍是：`BinaryOp<Add/Subtract/Multiply/TrueDivide>`。
- 说明“开关开了但时机不对”同样会错过快路径。

### 为什么 meta 版本“看起来能生效”
- 基于开源代码的推断：meta 环境通常在更热阶段编译，或默认统一开启 specialized-opcodes；因此更容易在编译时拿到已专门化字节码与类型守卫，触发 `DoubleBinaryOp` 下沉。
- 当前分支若在编译时机或 specialized-opcode 开关上不满足条件，就会退回 helper 路径，看起来像“快路径没生效”。

## 2026-03-05 PrimitiveUnbox CSE（远端闭环）
- 远端入口：`root@124.70.162.35`
- 目标：实现 HIR `PrimitiveUnbox` 公共子表达式消除（CSE），修复 `g(x)=x+x` 产生双 unbox 的问题。

### 改动
- 新增 pass：
  - `cinderx/Jit/hir/primitive_unbox_cse.h`
  - `cinderx/Jit/hir/primitive_unbox_cse.cpp`
- 编译管线接入：
  - `cinderx/Jit/compiler.cpp`
  - 在每次 `Simplify` 后运行 `PrimitiveUnboxCSE`。
- 回归测试：
  - `cinderx/PythonLib/test_cinderx/test_arm_runtime.py`
  - 新增 `test_primitive_unbox_cse_for_float_add_self`，断言 `PrimitiveUnbox == 1`。

### TDD 过程
1. RED（先失败）：
- 远端单测在改动前失败，`PrimitiveUnbox` 实际计数为 `2`（期望 `1`）。

2. 实现后首轮问题：
- 首版 pass 在遍历 block 时边遍历边 `ReplaceWith`，触发迭代器失效，报错：
  - `Assertion failed: block_ != nullptr`
  - `Instr isn't linked`
- 修复：改为“先 `++it` 再替换当前指令”的安全迭代。

3. GREEN（修复后通过）：
- 远端命令：
  - `PYTHONPATH=/root/work/cinderx-main/cinderx/PythonLib python -m unittest -v test_cinderx.test_arm_runtime.ArmRuntimeTests.test_primitive_unbox_cse_for_float_add_self`
- 结果：`OK`。

### 远端验证结果（HIR + 汇编）
1. HIR（`PYTHONJITDUMPFINALHIR=1`）：
- 关键片段：
  - `v13:CDouble = PrimitiveUnbox<CDouble> v10`
  - `v15:CDouble = DoubleBinaryOp<Add> v13 v13`
- 计数：
  - `hir_counts ... 'PrimitiveUnbox': 1, 'DoubleBinaryOp': 1`

2. `dump_elf` 架构确认：
- `file /tmp/unbox_cse_demo.elf`：
  - `ELF 64-bit ... ARM aarch64`
- `readelf -h`：
  - `Machine: AArch64`

3. AArch64 反汇编（`objdump`）：
- 函数：`__main__:g`
- 关键指令：
  - `1160: ldr d0, [x20, #16]`
  - `1164: fadd d8, d0, d0`
- 结论：重复 `ldr d0/d1` 已消除，达到“单次 unbox + 自加”预期。
# 2026-03-10 issue-15: slot version guard elimination

- Added HIR pass SlotVersionGuardElimination to deduplicate redundant LOAD_ATTR_SLOT / STORE_ATTR_SLOT tp_version_tag guards by dominating receiver/tag pair.
- The pass runs after Simplify and before PrimitiveUnboxCSE, and clears its active guard map on any instruction with arbitrary execution.
- Added ARM runtime regression test ArmRuntimeTests.test_slot_type_version_guards_are_deduplicated.
- Remote verification on 124.70.162.35 passed:
  - test_slot_type_version_guards_are_deduplicated
  - test_math_sqrt_cdouble_lowers_to_double_sqrt
  - test_math_sqrt_negative_input_preserves_value_error## 2026-03-10 Task: LOAD_GLOBAL mutable large int guard fix

### Design
- Issue: https://github.com/113xiaoji/cinderx/issues/16
- Actual code location in this branch: cinderx/Jit/hir/builder.cpp, emitLoadGlobal()
- Chosen fix: keep GuardIs by default, but downgrade mortal exact int globals to GuardType<LongExact>
- Reason: fixes the TIMESTAMP += 1 deopt pathology without broadly removing identity-based specialization for other globals

### TDD
- Added remote regression in cinderx/PythonLib/test_cinderx/test_arm_runtime.py:
  - ArmRuntimeTests.test_load_global_mutable_large_int_avoids_repeated_deopts
- RED command:
  - python cinderx/PythonLib/test_cinderx/test_arm_runtime.py ArmRuntimeTests.test_load_global_mutable_large_int_avoids_repeated_deopts -v
- RED result before fix:
  - AssertionError: 200 != 0

### Remote verification
- Entry: ssh root@124.70.162.35
- Remote workdir: /root/work/cinderx-main
- Remote venv: /root/venv-cinderx314
- Remote host could not fetch GitHub during FetchContent.
- Workaround:
  - synced fmt-src, parallel-hashmap-src, and usdt-src from local machine into remote _deps
  - rebuilt incrementally with:
    - cmake --build scratch/temp.linux-aarch64-cpython-314 --target _cinderx -- -j 1
  - replaced:
    - /root/venv-cinderx314/lib/python3.14/site-packages/_cinderx.so

### GREEN
- Targeted regression command:
  - python cinderx/PythonLib/test_cinderx/test_arm_runtime.py ArmRuntimeTests.test_load_global_mutable_large_int_avoids_repeated_deopts -v
- Result:
  - Ran 1 test ... OK

### HIR evidence
- Final HIR for Board.useful now shows all LOAD_GLOBAL: TIMESTAMP sites as:
  - GuardType<LongExact>
- No GuardIs remains on the TIMESTAMP global in the dumped function.

### Full remote regression
- Command:
  - python cinderx/PythonLib/test_cinderx/test_arm_runtime.py
- Result:
  - Ran 20 tests ... OK

## 2026-03-10 Issue 17 评估（远端闭环，未实施代码修改）
- 远端入口：`root@124.70.162.35`
- issue：`https://github.com/113xiaoji/cinderx/issues/17`
- 结论：issue 中提议的 `LoadGlobalCached + GuardIs` 去重在所给 case 上不安全，当前不应直接实现。

### 本地语义审查
- `LoadGlobalCached` 读取 `AGlobal`，不是纯常量。
- `GuardIs` 钉住对象身份，但不能跨“可能任意执行”的指令省略。
- `VectorCall` / `BinaryOp` 等在 HIR 里被标为 `hasArbitraryExecution = true`。

### 远端最小复现
- 复现脚本形状：
  - `a = func_g(x)`
  - `b = func_g(y)`
  - `return a + b`
- 远端 final HIR 结果：
  - `LoadGlobalCached: 2`
  - `GuardIs: 2`
  - `VectorCall: 2`
- 这说明重复加载存在，但两次加载之间隔着函数调用 barrier。

### 反例证明（关键）
- 远端构造：
  - 第一次调用 `func_g(x)` 时执行 `global func_g; func_g = func_h`
  - 第二次调用必须重新读取全局，才能看到 `func_h`
- 结果：
  - 期望值：`108`
  - 实际值：`108`
- 如果按 issue 建议把第二次 `LoadGlobalCached + GuardIs` 消掉，就会错误复用第一次守卫过的旧函数对象，语义将出错。

### 结论
- issue 17 当前描述的两个方案：
  - 方案 A：对 `LoadGlobalCached` 做局部 CSE
  - 方案 B：仅删除第二个 `GuardIs`
  在给定的跨调用场景中都不安全。
- 若未来继续做这类优化，范围必须缩小到：
  - 同一基本块内
  - 两次加载之间无 `hasArbitraryExecution` barrier
  - 无可能影响 `AGlobal` 观察结果的操作
- 本轮未提交 issue 17 代码修改。

## 2026-03-10 Issue 18：exact list slice specialization（远端闭环）
- 远端入口：`root@124.70.162.35`
- issue：`https://github.com/113xiaoji/cinderx/issues/18`
- 目标：对 exact list 的 `BuildSlice + BinaryOp<Subscript>` 做特化，去掉中间 `PySlice_New` 分配。

### 结论
- 已完成 exact-list slice 优化，范围限定为：
  - `TListExact`
  - `BuildSlice<2>`
  - `start/stop` 为 `NoneType` 或 `LongExact`
- 未覆盖：
  - 非 exact list
  - 带 `step` 的切片
  - 通用容器切片

### 实现
- 新增 HIR：`ListSlice`
- 新增 runtime helper：`JITRT_ListSlice(list, start, stop)`
- 新增 post-refcount 清理 pass：`ListSliceCleanup`
  - 删除特化后遗留的 dead `BuildSlice + Decref`
- 保留现有单元素下标快路径；issue 18 的“阶段 1”在 exact list 上本来就已经有了。

### 远端 HIR 验证
使用本地 exact list 复现函数：
- `lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`
- `left = lst[:mid]`
- `right = lst[mid + 1:]`
- `item = lst[mid]`

基线（clean worktree）final HIR opcode counts：
- `BuildSlice: 2`
- `BinaryOp: 2`
- `CheckSequenceBounds: 1`
- `LoadArrayItem: 1`
- `Decref: 4`

当前（modified worktree）final HIR opcode counts：
- `ListSlice: 2`
- `BuildSlice: 0`
- generic slice `BinaryOp`: 0
- `CheckSequenceBounds: 1`
- `LoadArrayItem: 1`
- `Decref: 2`

功能结果：
- `([10, 20], 30, [40, 50])`

### 远端 benchmark
- baseline worktree: `/root/work/cinderx-issue14-base`
- current worktree: `/root/work/cinderx-git`
- command style:
  - `taskset -c 0`
  - same GCC12 runtime library path
  - same Python interpreter
- workload：`test_local_list_slice()`
- iterations：`1,000,000`
- repeats：`7`

结果（median）：
- baseline: `1.3714s`
- current: `1.0596s`
- speedup: about `22.7%`

## 2026-03-11 Issue 18 follow-up：parameter-typed list specialization
- 问题：`def test_list_slice(lst: list): ...` 这种参数版测试在默认配置下最初没有命中 `ListSlice` / `LoadArrayItem`。
- 根因：参数注解默认没有进入 HIR 类型收窄；`lst` 在 final HIR 里仍是 `Object`。

### 方案
- 不再继续在 `BinaryOp<Subscript>` 上猜测 `Object -> ListExact`。
- 改为在 `specialized_opcodes` 开启时，默认装载函数注解，并为一小撮 builtin 注解类型插入口 `GuardType`：
  - `list`
  - `tuple`
  - `dict`
  - `str`
  - `int`
  - `float`
- 保留原来的 `emit_type_annotation_guards` 开关语义；如果显式开启，仍然走完整注解 guard 模式。

### 远端验证
- 远端入口：`root@124.70.162.35`
- 参数版复现：
  - `def test_list_slice(lst: list): ...`
- 当前 final HIR opcode counts：
  - `GuardType: 1`
  - `ListSlice: 2`
  - `LoadArrayItem: 1`
  - `BuildSlice: 0`
  - generic `BinaryOp`: 0
- 新增远端回归测试：
  - `test_cinderx.test_arm_runtime.ArmRuntimeTests.test_list_annotation_enables_exact_slice_and_item_specialization`
  - 结果：`OK`

### benchmark
- baseline: `0.8109s`
- current: `0.6255s`
- speedup: about `22.9%`
## 2026-03-11 Task: raytrace mixed numeric specialized-op fix

### Final fix
- File:
  - cinderx/Jit/hir/builder.cpp
- Policy:
  - for specialized numeric binary/compare opcodes, keep exact int guards only when the current code object has a backedge
  - for no-backedge leaf helpers, skip those exact int guards
  - float specialized-opcode guards remain enabled
- Reason:
  - raytrace leaf helpers like Vector.dot are mixed int/float and were deopting catastrophically under exact-int guards
  - broad numeric-guard removal helped raytrace but regressed existing float-path tests
  - the narrowed int-only no-backedge policy preserves float fast paths while fixing the mixed leaf case

### Remote verification
- Entry:
  - ssh root@124.70.162.35
- New targeted regression:
  - ArmRuntimeTests.test_specialized_numeric_leaf_mixed_types_avoid_deopts
  - result: OK
- Existing float regressions re-run and passed:
  - test_float_add_sub_mul_lower_to_double_binary_op_in_final_hir
  - test_math_sqrt_cdouble_lowers_to_double_sqrt
  - test_primitive_unbox_cse_for_float_add_self
  - test_primitive_box_remat_elides_frame_state_only_boxes
- Full remote file:
  - python cinderx/PythonLib/test_cinderx/test_arm_runtime.py
  - result: Ran 24 tests ... OK

### raytrace direct benchmark
- Command uses scripts/arm/bench_pyperf_direct.py against bm_raytrace/run_benchmark.py
- compile_strategy=all, samples=5:
  - median about 0.5742 s
  - total_deopt_count = 0
- compile_strategy=backedge, samples=5:
  - median about 0.6623 s
  - total_deopt_count = 0
- compile_strategy=none, samples=5:
  - median about 0.6025 s
  - total_deopt_count = 0
- Interpretation:
  - the final narrowed policy removes the catastrophic mixed-type deopt storm
  - on raytrace, CinderX JIT is now ahead of the previously recorded CPython JIT median (~0.6861 s)

## 2026-03-13 Issue 23: speculative long-loop unboxing

### Scope

  - `LongUnboxCompact`
  - compact-long `Guard` lowering

  - result: both `OK`

### final HIR
- `hot_loop(n)` now compiles to:
  - `CheckedIntBinaryOp: 2`
  - `LongUnboxCompact: 1`
  - `PrimitiveCompare: 1`
  - `PrimitiveBox: 1`
  - `LongInPlaceOp: 0`
  - `CompareBool: 0`
- The loop bound is guarded/unboxed once in the preheader.
- The loop-carried accumulator/counter are primitive phis.
- Only the final return is boxed.

### benchmark
- Workload:
  - `hot_loop(10000)`
  - `OUTER=2000`
  - `REPEATS=7`
- Result:
  - baseline median: `0.8305595869896933s`
  - current median: `0.028081598924472928s`
  - speedup: about `29.6x`
